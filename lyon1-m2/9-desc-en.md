# Ecofootprint

The global subject of this project was the visualization of "Climate Data".  
We as a group decided to concentrate our efforts on the ecological footprint, the deficit / reserve ratio and the overshoot day.  
You can find more details in the [README.md](https://github.com/dataviz9/ecofootprint.github.io) or on the website [here](https://dataviz9.github.io/ecofootprint.github.io/).
